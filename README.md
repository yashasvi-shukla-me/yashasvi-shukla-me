<h3 align="center">Full-stack engineer building scalable systems and production-ready AI/ML platforms</h3>

## About Me

I am a full-stack engineer with a strong backend and machine learning focus, experienced in building distributed systems, applied NLP solutions, and production-oriented ML platforms.

I work across the stack - designing APIs, backend services, data pipelines, and deploying containerized applications on cloud infrastructure. My recent work includes distributed code execution systems, resume intelligence platforms, and MLOps pipelines for model training and deployment.

Key areas I work in:
- Distributed backend systems and APIs
- Secure, containerized execution and system design
- Applied machine learning, NLP, and retrieval-augmented generation
- MLOps workflows including experiment tracking and deployment
